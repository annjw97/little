    <p> Hello! My name is Ann Jimin Woo and I am a student at SAIC.

      <p id="dream">
      So a little about this website.
      Little is the name of this data blog.
      Little is the place I share the most common websites I have visited for the past two weeks.
      I am not sharing my whole data history because I would like people to get to know me first as a person before they learn about my data history.
      However, I am sharing the once that I visited several times and places I spend majority of my time.
      I wanted to make Little pastel pink so that it looks painfully happy.
      This is not creepy at all~</p>
